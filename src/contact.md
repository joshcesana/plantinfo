  - If you have a question about plants that our databases can’t answer, don't despair! If you live in Minnesota, visit the University of Minnesota Extension's Gardening Information page. If you live anywhere in the USA you can ask a Master Gardener your question through the national eXtension system.
  - "Another option is to contact or visit your local library or a botanical or horticultural library. The Council on Botanical & Horticultural Libraries (CBHL) maintains a list of relevant libraries on their website: Botany, Horticulture and Natural Sciences Libraries, as does the European Botanical & Horticultural Libraries Group (EBHL)."
  - If you are affiliated with the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, you can submit your question to a librarian through AskUs.
